# Personalizing RNNs for Diabetes Prediction

This work represents my Master's thesis work, performed during my Data Science studies at the University of Milano-Bicocca. 

Specifically, I conducted a **comparative study** between the state-of-the-art Multitask personalized model, the General model, and a novel approach to personalization called **Threetask**, for the prediction of type 1 diabetes. The results showed an increase of **up to 10% in accuracy** for the Threetask model. The language used is **Python**, in particular the **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **PyTorch** and **scikit-learn** libraries.

The work was then published: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377092701_On_the_Use_of_Personalized_Models_for_Blood_Glucose_Concentration_Prediction.
