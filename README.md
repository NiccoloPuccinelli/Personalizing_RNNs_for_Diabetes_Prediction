# Personalizing RNNs for Diabetes Prediction

This work represents my Master's thesis work, performed during my Data Science studies at the University of Milano-Bicocca. 

Specifically, I conducted a **comparative study** between the state-of-the-art Multitask personalized model, the General model, and a novel approach to personalization called **Threetask**, for the prediction of type 1 diabetes. The results showed an increase of **up to 10% in accuracy** for the Threetask model. The language used is **Python**, in particular the **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **PyTorch** and **scikit-learn** libraries.

The work has been presented at ICCE Berlin 2023: https://edas.info/showPaper.php?m=1570939549.
